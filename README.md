Initial Questions:

Purchasing Patterns
1.	Which Coffee Products are purchased most frequently?
2.	Are there specific times of days, days of week, or months where coffee sales are highest?
3.	How do sales vary by product type (e.g., espresso, latte, black coffee)?
4.	What are the average purchase quantities per transaction?
5.	Is there a correlation between weather conditions and coffee sales?
Sales Trends

2.	Are there noticeable trends in sale growth or decline?
3.	Can any seasonality be detected in the sales data?
4.	Are there any spikes in sales related to specific events or promotions?
Customer Preferences 
1.	What are the most and least popular coffee products?
2.	Do customers exhibit loyalty to certain coffee products, or do they tend to vary their purchases?
3.	Are there identifiable customer segments based on their purchasing behavior?
4.	What factors (price, product availability, etc.) seem to influence customer choices?

I found this data on Kaggle. The first thing I did was create a list of questions a company would commonly want to make informed decisions and build a profile on their customer base. These questions seem to determine customer preferences, sales trends, and purchasing patterns.


First look at the Data
There are 6 columns of data
-	Date: standard mm/dd/yy date format
-	Datetime: hour, minute, second, they bought the coffee. Either am or pm
-	Cash_type: card of cash payment method
-	Card: Card number, a unique identifier per customer
-	Money: Dollar amounts spend on coffee
-	Coffee_name:  Type of coffee they bought

Take-Aways from Data Analysis
-	Targeted Marketing Opportunities
-	Identified brand loyalties 
-	Aware of needed information to identify spikes in sales
-	Vast Majority of customers use card
-	 App and cash account opportunities
-	Location specific product opportunities
-	Sur-charge opportunities

From this data we were able to extrapolate a lot of impactful information and identify exciting opportunities for growth.
Out of 1208 entries, 1119 are card. Our customer base is card dominated. This opens opportunities for an app. To beat processing charges and make checkout even more seamless, not needing to pull out a wallet to grab one card, we can implement an app. 
An app would allow for the opportunities to collect more data, marketing opportunities, customer satisfaction and community engagement, as well as implementation of a feature to load money onto the app, such as Starbucks, to keep customers loyal.
We did identify spikes in the sales data; however, we need further information such as location, weather, and traffic to identify further correlation to expose further opportunities around these sales spikes.
Location data would help identify opportunities for product specific locations. We have identified top producing products such as Americano with Milk and losing products such as Cocoa. This data paired with location data would allow strategic placement of products open vending machine to maximize sales and shorten product shelf life.
We have also identified popular times of day, an opportunity where a sur-charge can add to revenue. These high demand times, may be appropriate to implement inflated prices, due to the high demand.

Altogether this analysis has been quite profound. We now know crucial information to drive forward sales, increase revenue, and grow not only our customer base but our customer loyalty and engagement.
